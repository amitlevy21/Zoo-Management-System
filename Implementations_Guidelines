In this file we will specify the guidelines we follow in order to implement the H files.

The purpose of this file is to make sure both developers are consistent with writing their code, each in his part of the class diagram.

Amit:
added setName method that can throw exception if char* points to null or is an empty string.
Zoo - 1. changed methods addWorker & addAnimal - receives Area object instead of Area name.
      2. added const Area& findAreaIndex(const Area& area) const;
      3. In the methods addWorker & addAnimal we choose to iterate and check if the passed Area argument exists in the Zoo, not assuming that it was already added.
      4. operator[] now throws indexOutOfBound exception.
      5. changed operator + to +=
      6. main, used const cast. Also, we decided to get the input from the user about the areas of the zoo first, and then the input about the managers.
      7. I had issue with calling name from typeId. compiler said typeInfo doesn't have a function name and i read in stackoverflow its best to implement your own pure virtual function. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32016809/using-typeid-to-get-name-of-derived-class
